# **Metrocar: Funnel Analysis**
### **Executive Summary**
## **INTRODUCTION**

## **METHODOLOGY**

## **KEY FINDINGS**
The initial conversion from app download to signup is quite strong, demonstrating good user engagement from the start. The conversion from signup to ride requested is also notably high, suggesting that users quickly find value in the platform once they sign up. However, the conversion rate from ride requested to ride completed (50.2%) shows that half of the users who request a ride do not complete it.

This points to potential issues with ride availability, user interface challenges, or external factors affecting ride completion. While 90% of accepted rides are successfully completed, the acceptance rate of 64.4% suggests that there might be opportunities to improve how rides are matched between drivers and riders.

Rush hour, particularly between 8-9 AM and 4-7 PM, experiences the highest volume of ride requests, as well as the most cancellations. A significant number of rides are canceled without being accepted, which implies that there are challenges in matching drivers to requests during these peak periods. Furthermore, even for rides that are accepted, cancellations occur frequently during rush hours, likely due to long waiting times, which frustrate both users and drivers. These issues are compounded by long wait times during peak periods, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction and reduced future engagement with the platform.

Another major area of concern is user dissatisfaction, with 29.7% of users leaving 1-star ratings. The most frequent complaints involve drivers canceling last minute, unsafe driving, unprofessional behavior, app crashes, and inaccurate arrival times. Additionally, many comments mention poor vehicle conditions and overcharging incidents, further damaging user trust. Finally, while payment success rates are high, 4.9% of transactions fail, which could be caused by technical problems, user mistakes, or system inefficiencies.
